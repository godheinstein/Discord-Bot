# Discord Bots
 I made a myriad of Python discord bots with different functions

## How to use the discord bot
1. In your discord server, use the command prefix ">" 
2. Refer to "Features" for full list of commands

## Features/Functions
1. Hello function
   - using command >hello 
   - the bot will reply with "hello friend"
   
2. Delete/clear messages feature
   - using command >clear [int] or >purge [int]
   - replace [int] with the number of lines you wish to delete, 0<limit<100
   - the bot will delete the number of lines specified
   - useful for clearing junk texts in discord server
   
3. 8 Ball game
   - using command >8ball [question]
   - replace [question] with your desired yes/no questions
   - the bot will reply you yes or no answers to the question

4. Create a poll feature
   - using command >createpoll [question] [options]
   - replace [question] with the specified question, enclose your question within "[question]"
   - replace [options] with your desired options, using space as a divider, each option cannot have spaces, use _ to segment.
   - e.g >createpoll "What to eat for dinner?" rice fish_soup noodles
